# Language and Education
Bernstein defined two varieties of a language, called the elaborated code and the restricted code.  
The elaborated code uses standard grammatical syntax, complex sentences, prepositions, and a wide range of vocabulary. The restricted code uses short, simple and/or unfinished sentences, a few conjunctions, and confounds reasons and conclusions.
