# Standard Language
Standard language is a variety which, through human intervention, has undergone the process of standardisation.

The process of standardisation consists of

* selection – an existing variety or a mixture of existing varieties is chosen. The choice could be political or social.
* codification – some institution or agency works on arriving at the standard. *Correctness* is defined and enforced.
* elaboration
* acceptance  – once the community accepts the standard, it becomes a symbol of unique identity as opposed to other varieties.
