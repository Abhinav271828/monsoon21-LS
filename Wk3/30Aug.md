# Variation in Language
Labov made the distinction between a *variable* and a *variant*.  

A variable is an inconsistency or disagreement that a particular form of language may exhibit from an abstract standard. For example, the second person formal conjugation in Hindi is a variable.  

The variants of a variable are its forms; for example, the form [आप आओ]{lang=hi} of the conjugation is a variant.

## Variables as Indicators, Markers or Stereotypes
Variables can have different *social values* (separate from their linguistic values) associated with them:

* *indicators* have a demographic associated with them and are not subject to stylistic or situational change.
* *markers* are the change of a variant depending on casual or careful speech.
* *stereotypes* do not reflect social factors, but views about the norms of speech.
