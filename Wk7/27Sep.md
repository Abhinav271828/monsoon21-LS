# Language Contact and Convergence
When communities speaking different languages co-exist, several linguistic outcomes emerge.  
* A linking language, or lingua franca emerges.
* The languages borrow from each other.
* The languages converge, sometimes leading to the creation of new languages (pidgins and creoles).

## Lingua Franca

## Borrowing

## Convergence

## Pidgins and Creoles
A pidgin is a restricted language developed by two non-intersecting communities which interact frequently, and betwwen which one is in a more dominant position.  
It is *not* a result of borrowing. It has no native speakers and is used only in very restricted domain. It typically has a simplified grammar.  

A pidgin, once it acquires native speakers, is called a creole. The process whereby a pidgin becomes a creole is called creolisation.
