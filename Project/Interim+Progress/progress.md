# Progress
## Data Collection
I have been able to collect data consistently from casual conversation, as stated. I now have more than 50 data points, which illustrate many of the syntactic differences of Indian English from British English that I had in mind.  

## Literature Review
I have read one paper[^1] and the relevant sections (1. Introduction and 5. Morphosyntax) of one book[^2], both of which I have mentioned in my literature survey.

# Further Steps
First, I plan to complete the reading of the relevant sections of the other two books mentioned in my literature survey. Parallelly with this, I will continue to collect data.  

Then, I will make a study of the syntactic features illustrated in the data. It can also be compared with the findings of the authors of the books and paper mentioned in the survey, to obtain information on the differences (if any) between Bangalorean Indian English and general Indian English (if this can be said to exist, which is debatable).
