# About
*Anglo-Indian English: A nativized variety of Indian English* is a paper detailing and analysing the results of a sociolinguistic study conducting on Tamil-English bilingual Anglo-Indians from Perambur, Chennai. The participants' speech was recorded and various features were isolated. Some of these features correspond with features in the dialect under study (the Indian English of middle-class urban-resident South Indians). Possible sources of these features are also discussed.  

*Contemporary Indian English: Variation and Change* lays out a description of the history of English in India and of the study of Indian English. Divergences in Indian English's vocabulary, lexicosyntax and morphosyntax are studied.  

*Dialects of English: Indian English* gives some cultural background on Indian English, and provides a description of the history of Indian English, a survey of previous work, and sample texts. In addition to vocabulary and morphosyntax, the phonetics and phonology are also considered.  

*The Syntax of Spoken Indian English* is a detailed study of syntax (which is the only aspect under consideration for the project). In addition to studies of syntactic features, it includes some conceptual introduction to Indian English itself.
