Abstract
- native speakers neglected
- anglo-indian community
- similar to general IE
- sources

# Intro
- only 5 publications on AI community
- inadequate
- interest in institutionalised use of English
- historical process -> distinctiveness
- shift-based not transplant-based
- here
    - SAsE as L1
    - Perambur, Chennai
    - two issues: comparison with general IE and social variation in AI
- Thomas & Kaufman (1988) – contact-induced change
- phonology & syntax

# Social BG
- Christian, English, mixed ancestry
- consciousness <- unique experience under raj
- English is "mother tongue"
- favourable policies by raj, but socially not accepted
    - resentment by indians
    - loyal to brits, looked down on indians
    - some degree of indianisation, but no record of earlier stages
- exposed to standard and nonstandard BE

# Method
- Aug '93, Madras (Perambur)
- 20-35 yo, females, English L1, Christian
- Hindi, French, Tamil maybe
- 5 per class UMC, LMC, LC
- /h/, less aux mvmt

# Some Features
## Similarities to General IE
- retroflex stops for alveolar stops (vary)
- dental stops for interdental fricatives (vary with retro/alv)
- no aspirated allophones (unpredictable)
- no velar l
- partial merger of [v], [w] (vary)
- monophthongs for /ey, au/
- /o/ in four, bored, course
- stress, vowel reduction

- free variation in all except velar l, monophthongs, /o/
- stress could correlate with class but dk
•
- invariant tag (is it, isn't it [rare], no)
- aux-mvmt in wh-questions (vary)
- wh-mvmt always there

- tags correspond to iliya, aa
- e, o could be inherited or transferred
- /o/ in four etc is inheritance only (old BE)

## Defferences from General IE
- /h/-dropping
- r-lessness uniform

- some /h/ dropping in standard english also, but this is more
- /r/ is rhotic in onset, schwa/lengthening/deleted before consonants or pause

- both probably inheritance
- /h/ could be Tamil

# Aux-Mvmt in Closed Qs
- AmE use intonation-based qs but add discourse markers
- IE is more

# Class-Based Variation in /h/, Aux
- LC vs LMC+UMC

- for /h/, some words eliminated
- low income <-> more dropping, less wh-mvmt
- low education <-> less aux-mvmt (optional in std?)

- social gaps between L/M reflected in data

# Conclusion
- similar except in /h/ and /r/
- IE in SA also does /h/, IE in Delhi does /r/
- mostly transfer, some inheritance, some both
- /h/ nonstandard BE, rest inh would be std
- development unclear
- no correlation between bilingualism in Tamil and variation
