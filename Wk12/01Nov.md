# Conversational Norms
There are some parameters of conversational norms that vary from society to society, like conversational turn-taking and information content.  

Speech also reflects the social relations between the speaker and the addressee, with the aspects of power and solidarity.  
Four possible universals are suggested:

* every language has some way of signalling differences in either power or solidarity or both.
* power and solidarity are often expressed by the same range of forms.
* the conflict-free prototypes of the range of forms are a close subordinate and a distant superior.
* there is a generalisation about the use of names following the third universal (given names or role-based names).
