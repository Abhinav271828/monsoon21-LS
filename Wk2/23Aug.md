# Introduction (contd.)
There are two ways of looking at language â€“ the _prescriptive_ and the _descriptive_.  

The attempts of linguistic theory to undersand the general principles of organisation of language led to notions like

* _langue_ and _parole_ (de Saussure)
* _contrastive_ and _complementary_ distribution (Bloomfield)
* _emic_ and _etic_ (Pike and Sapir)
* _surface_ and _deep_ (Chomsky)
