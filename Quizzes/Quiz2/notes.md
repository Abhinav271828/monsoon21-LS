- shift in phonetic position of fst /ay/, /aw/
- Martha's Vineyard, Mass.
- recent history by studying freq, dist
- social factors by correlation
- 3 problems in lang change:
    - origin of variations
    - spread/propagation
    - regularity

- POV: one cannot understand the development of a language change apart from the social life of the community in which it occurs
- spread: before spread, one of the rivals should acquire prestige

# The Island of Martha's Vineyard
- self-contained unit
- social and geographic complexity
- LANE (> 30 years ago)
- up: rural; down: populated
- 4 ethnic groups: english, portuguese, indian, misc.
- summer residents

- best known for r-pronouncing
- short /o/
- lexical relics

- we want to understand internal structure
- no contrast
- changes now taking place

# Selection of the Linguistic Variable
- frequent
- structural
- stratified distribution

- salient but immune from conscious distortion
- in 1961, changes were noted, but like mainland
- postvocalic /r/ is idiosyncratic
- height of fst /ay/, /aw/ (stratified)

# The History of Centralised Diphthongs
- mid-central vowel in 16, 17th c. english

# The Investigation of (ay) and (aw)
- lexical questionnaire
- questions of value judgements
- reading
- casual observations

# Scales of Measurement
- six-point scale
- acoustic spectrograms
- phonetic jargon

# The Linguistic Environment
- plot
- segmental environment
- prosodic factors
- stylistic influence
- lexical considerations
- distribution by age and time

- drop then rise in centralisation

# Possible Explanations for a Rise in Centralisation
- distributions by occupation, ethnicity
- social structure?

# The Interaction of Linguistic and Social Patterns
- poor
- unemployment
- high cost
- economic pressure
- no industry
- summer trade
- -> defensive contempt to enthusiastic plans
- high centralisation <-> resistance
- rural upland, fishing
- fishermen show highest
- peak in centralisation in 30-45 age group
- hypercorrection

# Centralisation among Other Ethnic Groups
- portuguese have defensive attitude
- 3rd, 4th gen. centralisation rise
- identify with island
- mostly stay

- indian is small and homogeneous
- resentment
- greater relative increase of centralisation of (aw), otherwise close behind

# The Social Meaning of Centralisation
- "vineyarder"
- old: outside pressure
- started with fishermen
- dramatised
- young: stay or leave?

- portuguese: islander

- indian: follow chilmark

# The Intersection of Social and Linguistic Structures
- not salient in consciousness
- not directly affected by social perceptions
- 14 such variables

# Limitations of This Study
- not salient variable
- small size
- nonrigorous sampling
- inadequate cases for portuguese, indians
- not controlled
