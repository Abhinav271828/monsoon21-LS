# Introduction
- differential response to educational opportunity made by children from different social classes
- questions about transmission of behavioural implications of physical and social envt to child

- two elements of language: formal elements (structure), words (vocabulary)
- finite set of options at both levels
- "what can be done"

- speech is constrained by circumstances, social relation
- "what is done"
- indicates choice of options

- social structure between language and speech
- regulates options selected by speakers
- establishes "coding principles", principles of choice

- summary
    - different social structures generate diff speech systems or linguistic codes
    - entail principles of choice which regulate choices
    - elicit, strengthen, and stabilise planning procedures

# Elaborated and Restricted Linguistic Codes
- questions
    - what kind of social relations $\to$ what kind of speech systems?
    - principles controlling speech systems?
    - relationships these principles give access to, stabilise?
- two general systems
    - defined i.t.o of options of structure
    - not vocab
- elaborated code: wide range of syntactic alternatives; choice difficult to predict
- restricted code: range is considerably reduced, vocab less (but not conclusive)

- elaborated code $\to$ facilitate expression of purposes, intent, unique experience verbally explicitly
- restricted code $\to$ not facilitate verbal expansion

- elaborate takes higher level of verbal planning than restricted

- different dimensions of significance
- events in envt which take on significance when the code is used are different for both
    - social, intellectual, emotional
- codes are generated by particular forms of social relationships

- first some variants of a RC
    - exemplify social characteristics
    - pure form
    - verbal component highly predictable (given social context, code)

## Restricted Code (Lexicon Prediction)
- verbal/extraverbal components
    - v: words
    - ev: intonation, gesture, expression

- first variant: maximal redundancy from both persps
- rigid and extensive prescriptions
- social relations $\in$ religious, legal and military social structures
- few options
- individual $\to$ cultural agent (interpret: part of institution, a gear in a machine)
- messages which depart from max. red. are violations/profane

- second variant: less redundancy in ev, approaching max in v
- mother telling stories to child
- only ev channels can be varied
- saliency of ascribed status aspects of social relation generates characteristics of order of communication
- code defines channels
- ev channels are "objects of special perceptual activity"

- third variant: just like second
- ev channels are "objects of special perceptual activity" again
- boy asks girl to dance in club
- low predictability about intent $\to$ exchange of social routines approaching max red
- what is said is impersonal
- development of relation depends on ev messages
- greater use of potential options in ev channels

- all three have characteristics
    - status aspect of social relation is salient
    - new info made avail through ev channels
    - discrete intent transmitted through variations in ev signals
    - reinforces form of social relation by restricting verbal signalling

## Restricted Code (High Structural Prediction)
- most general (emp)
- only syntactic alternatives are predictable
- many more options for v, ev than in RC(LP)
- function of form of social relation
- assumptions common to speakers, shared interests, identifications, expectations : local cultural identity
- reduces need to make intent explicit

- closed communities: prisons, combat units, criminal subcultures, peer groups, married couples

- characteristics (suppose observing a close relationship)
    - difficult to follow speech
    - impersonal sequences
        - fewer qualifiers
        - active voice
        - more "you", "they"; less "I"
    - vitality of speech?
        - how, not what
    - disjunctive sequences
        - logical gaps
    - concrete, narrative and descriptive
        - abstract would use "you see", "you know" etc
- unique meaning tends to be implicit

- a considerable section of society has access only to this code by implications of class background

- same dimension as RC(LP) but at opposite end
- ev signals are important bearers of meaning and OoSPA
- status aspect of social relation is salient with a consequent reduction in role discretion
- facility for transmission of global, concrete, descriptive, narrative stmts
- discrete intent unlikely to be raised to the level of elaboration

## Elaborate Codes (Low Structural Prediction)
- RC: status-oriented pseech systems
      reinforce form of social relation by limiting the verbal signalling of personal difference
- EC: extensive range of syntactic alternatives
      allows speaker to make discrete intent explicit
      discrete intent may not be taken for granted
- condition of listener taken into account
- person-oriented: focus on other person as a diff experience

- RC: verbal transmission = status/membership of alter, shared assumptions
- EC: listener dependent on verbal elaboration of meaning
      v becomes OoSPA

- differences in role relations presupposed by codes
    - range of discretion in role of EC
    - social history must have practice, training
    - less support from shared expectations
    - social isolation; speaker differentiated from group
- codes are translations of different forms of social relations
- speakers limited to either code might not be able to switch

- EC generated originally by the form of the social relation becomes a facility for indiv. verbal responses
- planning procedures used in preparation and reception of speech are creating code
- higher level of structural organisation and vocabulary selection

- learning is different for both codes
- EC perceives language as a set of theoretical possibilities
    - concept of self is verbally differentiated
    - OoSPA
- RC: concept of self refracted through the implications of status arrangements
    - "problem of self is not relevant"

- purpose of EC is preparation and delivery of relatively explicit meaning
- relatively frequent pauses, hesitations
- monitoring/self-editing system
- difference in time dimension has psychological consequences

- child learning EC orients towards verbal channel
    - learns to scan particular syntax, receive
    and transmit particular pattern of meaning
    - manage role requirements, becomes aware of order of relationships (intellectual, social, emotional)
    - EC induces developmentally in speakers an expectation of separateness and difference from others

- two modes
    - one facilitates relations between persons
    - other between objects

- child limited to restricted code develops through regulation in code (?)
    - speech is not OoSPA
    - no theoretical attitude towards structural possibilities of sentence organisation
    - facility for transmitting and receiving concrete, global, descriptive, narrative stmts
    - low level of conceptualisation
    - reduced self-editing function, ev channels for discrete intent
    - v channel promotes social symbols transmission

- orientation towards codes independent of psychology
- governed by form of social relation/quality of social structure

- relations between social class and two coding systems
- normative systems of middle-class etc $\to$ elaborated code
                       working class $\to$ restricted code
- crude index
- consider family role system, mode of social control, and the resultant verbal feedback (??)

- middle-class child: both codes
- (esp. lower) working class: restricted
- school: EC critical

- confirmed with small samples
- verbal IQ scores less for restricted code

# Conclusion
- attempt to show how two general coding systems and their variants are elicited by the structure of social relations
- dimensions of relevance created by different coding systems
- examine broad social class affiliations of codes
- socialising and formal educational consequences
- more generally, should be found in any social structure where originating conditions exist
- range of languages
