### Restricted and Elaborate Codes
- Bernstein influenced by Whorf
- considers language both influencing and influenced by culture
- direct and reciprocal relationship between a kind of social structure (establishment and maintenance) and way people in it use language
- continuing relationship
- cycle between social structure and linguistic behaviour

- individuals learn social roles through communication
- process differs from social group to social group $\to$ perpetuation of existing role differences
- two varieties of language in use: elaborated and restricted code

- EC: "accurate" grammatical syntax, complex sentences, prepositions to show relationships, frequent use of *I*, wide range of adjectives, adverbs, qualification of remarks
- points to possibilities inherent in complex conceptual hierarchy for organising experience

- RC: short, simple, unfinished syntactic form, few conjunctions, little subordination, dislocated presentation, rigid and limited adjectives, adverbs, sympathetic circularity, implicit meaning

- every speaker has access to restricted code
- fewer have access to elaborate code (working class)
- disadvantage in school, which tries to change cultural patterns
- results in educational failure

- **British social-class system** does not allow LWC easy access to EC

- criticism: not looked closely enough at WC life, language; poorly defined terms; circular arguments
- raises issue of relationship between home language and educational practices
