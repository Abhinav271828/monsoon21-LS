# Bilingualism Fieldwork
## Person 1
My mother speaks Hindi (H), English (E), Malayalam (M) and Kannada (K). Her use of the languages varies according to the context as follows.

### People
If the addressee is monolingual or can only understand one of her four languages, she restricts herself to that language. For example, she speaks only K with the maid and the support staff at her workplace[^1].  

In other cases, she usually codemixes, but not freely. Her children (my brother and I) understand all four of her languages, but she speaks only (codemixed) M and E with us. Similarly, her sister, mother and husband understand all four of her languages, but she speaks Hindi with them almost exclusively.  

She speaks codemixed M, H and E with her sisters-in-law.  

She speaks codemixed E and H, codemixed E and M, or codemixed E and K with her colleagues at her workplace, according to the common languages (*not* their mothertongues; for example, codemixed E and H with her Tamil-speaking colleagues if they speak H).  

It is worth remarking that although the cook speaks and understands Hindi and Kannada, they converse only in Hindi.
 
[^1]: Notably, she understands Tamil, and there is a support staff member who addresses her in Tamil but to whom she responds in Kannada. Conversation flows naturally despite the difference.

### Situation
In taxis, autorickshaws, and shops, she usually speaks K, unless she knows that the other speaks M or H better. E is almost never used in these situations.  

In a classroom, she uses only E.

### Topic
She discusses subject-specific topics (usually biology) in either E or codemixed H and E, depending on who else is participating in the conversation.  

With her children, she uses M for common phrases like "wake up", "come here", etc., but M and E interchangeably otherwise.

## Person 2
My father speaks Hindi (H), English (E) and Malayalam (M). His use of the languages varies according to the context as follows.

### People
If there is only one common language, again, he restricts himself to it. He therefore speaks H with his colleagues at his workplace.  

He codemixes M, H and E with his children (my brother and me), to some extent. He codemixes the same three languages, although much more freely, with his sisters, but speaks only M with his mother.  

He speaks only H with his wife and only M with his mother-in-law, although they share all three of his languages.  

He codemixes H and E with his close friends, most of whom speak H, E and K. He also uses M with those of his friends who speak it.

### Situation
He is not comfortable with Kannada (K) but can make himself understood; he therefore speaks it in taxis and autorickshaws most of the time, occasionally relapsing into H.  

He speaks only E in formal situations, *i.e.*, in speeches etc., even if the addressee(s) has/have other common languages.

### Topic
In discussing business or technology, he uses H and E at his workplace, but usually only E with family or in casual conversation.  

With his children, he uses M and H for certain common phrases, like "come fast", "park the car", etc. He uses E more often than M otherwise, and almost never H.

## Person 3
My grandmother speaks Malayalam (M), Hindi (H), and English (E), and can make herself understood in Tamil (T) and Kannada (K). Her use of the languages varies according to the context as follows.

### People
She speaks amost only H with her children, and only M with her siblings, siblings-in-law, and sons-in-law. However, all of them share M, H and E with her.  

Remarkably, she speaks H better than T, and although the cook speaks H almost as well as T, they converse in T. She uses only K with the maid, who is monolingual.  

With her grandchildren (my brother, my cousins and me), she uses M and E. She, too, uses M mostly for common phrases, but more frequently than my parents; in other cases, however, she uses E almost all the time.  

She does not codemix, but speaks only E, K or M with her neighbourhood friends, according to their level of familiarity with the languages. M is her first preference, followed by E and then K.

### Situation
She uses only K in shops, autos, taxis, the post office, etc.  

She generally uses M with a fellow speaker, even at the first meeting. In formal and semi-formal situations with strangers, she speaks E.

### Topic
She generally sticks to the distribution described above according to the addressee, and does not switch. This can be attributed to the fact that she is not accustomed to codemixing.

## Person 4
My brother speaks English (E) and Hindi (H). He speaks conversational Kannada (K) and can understand Malayalam (M) well. His use of the languages varies according to the context as follows.

### People
He, too, does not frequently codemix.  

He speaks only English with his brother, parents and grandmother (all listed above), although all these share H with him. He speaks only H with the cook and only K with the maid.

### Situation
He speaks only E at his workplace.  

Like others, he speaks K in taxis, autorickshaws, shops and buses for the most part. On occasion, he uses H.

### Topic
His choice is mostly dictated by situation and addressee, and therefore topic is usually not a relevant factor in the context. He does not speak languages other than E except when E is not a common language.

# Codemixing and Codeswitching
The following 100 tweets were scraped from Twitter using tweepy. They have been cleaned of hashtags and slogans *except* when these are used as a natural part of the sentence. Mentions of the addressee, links and emojis are also removed.  

They all contain Hindi and English text in the Latin script (Devanagari is rarely present and has been converted to WX for tagging).

## Analysis
Codemixing between Hindi and English appears to be extremely free from the above corpus. It occurs at the word, phrase, clause and sentence levels.  

An English word/phrase is often used in Hindi speech (or vice versa) when the equivalent word/phrase in the other language either does not exist or is too formal/informal. For example, "[देसी]{lang=hi}" in Hindi and "pet" in English. The case of phrases is similar.  

Notably, English verbs used in Hindi have the words "[करना]{lang=hi}" or "[होना]{lang=hi}" used after them, like most Hindi verbs. The English words are not conjugated themselves.  

At the clause level, both main and subordinate clauses are exchanged. Examples of both these processes are seen in the corpus.  
As examples of subordinate-clause codemixing, a [जो]{lang=hi}-clause entirely in Hindi can be used to qualify an English noun, and a quoted phrase (preceded by "that" or "[कि]{lang=hi}") can be in the opposite language from the main clause.  
When two main clauses are in different languages, the connecting conjunction is usually in English ("and", "or" or "but").  

Codemixing at the sentence boundary is, in a vague sense, the most "acceptable" form of codemixing. More concretely, appears from the corpus that people who do not regularly codemix intra-sententially have no problem switching languages between sentences.  

Besides these cases, it is ordinary for common or well-known phrases or slogans to be in the original language, regardless of which language they are being quoted in.
