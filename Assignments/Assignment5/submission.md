# Introduction
The languages under consideration will be English and Malayalam. The following conceptual spaces will be studied:

* kinship terms
* colour terms
* body parts

# Kinship Terms
We will distinguish three types of relation according to generation (one or more generations lower, same generation, one or more generations higher); and two types according as whether or not it is a relation by marriage.

## English
English has a simple system for describing family relations.

* **One or more generations lower.** The blood relations are:
    - *son*, *daughter*
    - *(great-)grandson*, *(great-)granddaughter*
    - *niece*, *nephew* (child of any relative in the same generation)
    - *(great-)grandniece*, *(great-)grandnephew*  

    There are also the umbrella terms *child* and *grandchild*. The umbrella term for *niece* and *nephew* is simply *nephew*.  

    The corresponding relations by marriage are:
    - *son-in-law*, *daughter-in-law*
    - *niece by marriage*, *nephew by marriage*  

    Umbrella terms do not exist for these relations.

* **Same generation.** The blood relations are:
    - *brother*, *sister*
    - *(first, second, ...) cousin*  

    Gender is not distinguished by *cousin*, except in Indian English (*cousin-brother* and *cousin-sister*). The umbrella term for *brother* and *sister* is *sibling*.  

    The corresponding relations by marriage are:
    - *brother-in-law*, *sister-in-law*
    - *co-brother*, *co-sister* (Indian English)
    - *cousin by marriage*  

    Umbrella terms do not exist for the first two sets of terms. A *co-brother* (*co-sister*) is a man (woman) whose wife (husband) is one's spouse's sister (brother).  

    Note that the child or parent of a ($n^\text{th}$) cousin by marriage is called a ($n^\text{th}$) *cousin once removed*; similarly, a grandparent or grandchild is a ($n^\text{th}$) cousin twice removed, and so on.

* **One or more generations higher.** The blood relations are:
    - *mother*, *father*
    - *grandmother*, *grandfather*
    - *aunt*, *uncle*
    - *grandaunt*, *granduncle*  

    The umbrella terms *parent* and *grandparent* cover the first two sets. The terms *aunt* and *uncle* refer to any relative of the same generation as one's parents (who is not one's parent). *Grandaunt* and *granduncle* are analogous.  

    The relations by marriage are:
    - *mother-in-law*, *father-in-law*
    - *aunt by marriage*, *uncle by marriage*

## Malayalam
Malayalam's kinship system is slightly more detailed than English's in most cases.

* **One or more generations lower.** The blood relations are:
    - [മകൻ]{lang='ml'} `makan` (son), [മകൾ]{lang='ml'} `makalY` (daughter)
    - [കൊച്ചുമകൻ]{lang='ml'} `koccumakan` (grandson), [കൊച്ചുമകൾ]{lang='ml'} `koccumakalY` (granddaughter)
    - [മരുമകൻ]{lang='ml'} `marumakan` (nephew), [മരുമകൾ]{lang='ml'} `marumakalY` (niece)  

    The umbrella terms for the first two groups are [കുട്ടി]{lang='ml'} `kutti` (child) and [കൊച്ചുകുട്ടി]{lang='ml'} `koccukutti` (grandchild; alternatively, [പേരക്കുട്ടി]{lang='ml'} `perakkutti`).  

    The terms for relations by marriage are:
    - [മരുമകൻ]{lang='ml'} `marumakan` (son-in-law), [മരുമകൾ]{lang='ml'} `marumakalY` (daughter-in-law)  
    
    Note that these are identical to the terms for nephew and niece.  

* **Same generation.** The blood relations are:
    - [ആങ്ങള]{lang='ml'} `AffalYa` (brother, where ego is female), [പെങ്ങള]{lang='ml'} `peVffalYa` (sister, where ego is male)
    - [ചേട്ടൻ]{lang='ml'} `cettan` (elder brother), [ചേച്ചി/ചേട്ടത്തി]{lang='ml'} `cecci/cettawwi` (elder sister)
    - [അനിയൻ]{lang='ml'} `aniyan` (younger brother), [അനിയത്തി]{lang='ml'} `aniyawwi` (younger sister)  
    
    There are, again, no umbrella terms, and no terms which are neutral to *both* age and the gender of ego.  
    
    The relations by marriage are:  
    - [അളിയൻ]{lang='ml'} `alYiyan` (brother-in-law)
    - [നാത്തൂൻ]{lang='ml'} `nAwwUn` (husband's sister)
    - [എടത്തിയമ്മ]{lang='ml'} `etawwiyamma` (brother's wife)  
    
    Notably, there is only one term for brother-in-law, but two for sister-in-law.

* **One or more generations higher.** The blood relations are:
    - [അമ്മ]{lang='ml'} `amma` (mother), [അച്ഛൻ]{lang='ml'} `acCan` (father)
    - [വലിയമ്മ]{lang='ml'} `valiyamma` (either parent's elder sister/cousin)
    - [വലിയച്ഛൻ]{lang='ml'} `valiyacCan` (either parent's elder brother/cousin)
    - [ചെറിയമ്മ]{lang='ml'} `cerYiyamma` (either parent's younger sister/cousin)
    - [ചെറിയച്ഛൻ]{lang='ml'} `cerYiyacCan` (either parent's younger brother/cousin)
    - [അമ്മാവൻ/മാമൻ]{lang='ml'} `ammAvan/mAman` (mother's brother)
    - [മുത്തശ്ശൻ]{lang='ml'} `muwwaSSan` (maternal (great-)grandfather), [മുത്തശ്ശി]{lang='ml'} `muwwaSSi` (maternal (great-)grandmother)
    - [അമ്മമ്മ]{lang='ml'} `ammamma` (maternal grandmother)
    - [അച്ഛമ്മ]{lang='ml'} `acCamma` (paternal grandmother), [അച്ഛച്ഛൻ]{lang='ml'} `acCacCan` (paternal grandfather)
    - [അപ്പൂപ്പൻ]{lang='ml'} `appUppan` (grandfather)
    
    There is no umbrella term corresponding to `parent` or `grandparent`.  
    
    The relations by marriage have the following terms:
    - [അമ്മായിയമ്മ]{lang='ml'} `ammAyiyamma` (mother-in-law), [അമ്മായിയച്ഛൻ]{lang='ml'} `ammAyiyacCan` (father-in-law)
    - [വലിയമ്മ]{lang='ml'} `valiyamma` (either parent's elder brother's/cousin's wife)
    - [വലിയച്ഛൻ]{lang='ml'} `valiyacCan` (either parent's elder sister's/cousin's husband)
    - [ചെറിയമ്മ]{lang='ml'} `cerYiyamma` (either parent's younger brother's/cousin's wife)
    - [ചെറിയച്ഛൻ]{lang='ml'} `cerYiyacCan` (either parent's younger sister's/cousin's husband)
    - [അമ്മായി]{lang='ml'} `ammAyi` (aunt by marriage)
    
    The presence of a specific term for only aunts by marriage is surprising, as there is no such for the male counterpart.

# Colour Terms
## English
English has a very wide range of colour terms. The spectrum is divided mainly into 7 colours (*violet*, *indigo*, *blue*, *green*, *yellow*, *orange*, *red*), but there are several other colours, like *black*, *white*, *grey*, *beige*, *maroon*, *brown*, *purple*, *cyan*, *crimson*, *scarlet*, *mauve*, *lavender*, etc.  

These can be qualified by *light* or *dark*.  

The boundaries between many of these are poorly defined, and it is not always clear which is which, however.  

## Malayalam
Malayalam has a simple colour range with a few native colour terms and some more English words in common use.  

The native Malayalam colour words include:

* [ചുവപ്പ്/ചുമപ്പ്]{lang='ml'} `cuvapp/cumapp` (red)
* [കറുപ്പ്]{lang='ml'} `karYupp` (black)
* [വെളുപ്പ്]{lang='ml'} `velYupp` (white)
* [നീല]{lang='ml'} `nIla` (blue)
* [പച്ച]{lang='ml'} `pacca` (green)
* [മഞ്ഞ]{lang='ml'} `maFFa` (yellow)
* [തവിട്ട്]{lang='ml'} `wavitt` (brown)

In addition to these, [ഓരഞ്ച്]{lang='ml'} `oranc` (orange), [പർപ്പിൾ]{lang='ml'} `parppilY` (purple), etc. are commonly used as loanwords.  

Any of these words can be qualified by [ഇളം]{lang='ml'} `ilYam` (light) or [കടും]{lang='ml'} `kaduM` (dark).  

Note: the first three colour terms in the above list are *nouns* – redness, blackness, and whiteness. The corresponding adjectives are in fact verbal formations; the verbs [ചുവക്കുക]{lang='ml'} `cuvakkuka` (to turn red), [കറുക്കുക]{lang='ml'} `karYukkuka` (to turn black) and [വെളുക്കുക]{lang='ml'} `velYukkuka` (to turn white) are the infinitives, from which are formed [ചുവന്ന]{lang='ml'} `cuvanna` (red = having turned red), [കറുത്ത]{lang='ml'} `karYuwwa` (black = having turned black) and [വെളുത്ത]{lang='ml'} `velYuwwa` (white = having turned white).  

The remaining four colour terms are adjectives, but it is more common to use the formation X [നിറമുള്ള]{lang='ml'} `X nirYamulYlYa` (having the colour X), *e.g.* [പച്ചനിറമുള്ള]{lang='ml'} `paccanirYamulYlYa` (green = having the colour green).

# Body Parts
## English
English has a fairly complete system for naming the parts of the body. Some terms for body parts in English are:

* *head*, *face*, *eye*, *mouth*, *nose*, *tongue*, *ear*
* *arm*, *hand*, *shoulder*, *elbow*
* *leg*, *foot*, *thigh*, *calf*, *knee*
* *chest*, *stomach*

## Malayalam
The Malayalam words for body parts do not make some of the distinctions made by the English terms. They are:

* [തല]{lang='ml'} `wala` (head), [കണ്ണ്]{lang='ml'} `kaNN` (eye), [വായ]{lang='ml'} `vAya` (mouth), [മൂക്കൻ]{lang='ml'} `mUkk` (nose), [നാവ്]{lang='ml'} `nAv` (tongue), [ചെവി]{lang='ml'} `ceVvi` (ear)
* [കൈ]{lang='ml'} `kai` (arm/hand), [തോൾ]{lang='ml'} `wolY` (shoulder), [മുട്ട്]{lang='ml'} `mutt` (elbow)
* [കാൽ]{lang='ml'} `kAl` (leg/foot), [മുട്ട്]{lang='ml'} `mutt` (knee)
* [മാറ്]{lang='ml'} `mArY` (chest), [വയറ്]{lang='ml'} `vayarY` (stomach)

Note specifically the conflation of "hand"/"arm", "foot"/"leg", and "elbow"/"knee".
