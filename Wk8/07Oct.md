# Quantitative Sociolinguistics Methods
Quantitative sociolinguistics is the field-based approach to studying linguistic phenomena in language use. It considers the correlation between linguistic variables and social variables.  

Quantitative studies need to be

* statistically sound in data sampling, data treatment and hypothesis testing
* validated
* reliable

## Method
The various steps in a study are:

* Identification of linguistic and social variables
* Data sampling
* Collection
* Analysis and Interpretation

When samping, there are linguistic and social aspects to be considered.  

There are various methods for collection: for example, interviews, questionnaires and surveys. One must, however, be wary of bias. The Observer's Paradox is a common pitfall – if the subject knows they are being observed, they do not act naturally.  

Analysis and interpretation involves finding patterns in the collected data and interpreting them.
